*1. Download the preprocessed data from the following repository and save it under the folder name data/data_100 for QM9 or data/data_278 for ZINC
## Install the dependencies:##
The current code depends on pytorch 0.5.0a0. All the dependency is discribed in requirement.txt file. You can also use the Dockerfile to set all the dependency.
## Training ##
There are two kind of model: main_1.py corresponding where we update both the propery estimator and encoder decoder parameters, while main_3.py corresponding to the model we pretrain property estimator and never update it again during main model training phase.
To train CGD_GRU_1 model for QM9, run:
'''
cd zinc/zinc_1_gru/main_1.py
'''
